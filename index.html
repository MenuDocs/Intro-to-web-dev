            In the video, the author has accidentally used the tag 'p'.
            However, we are using the title tag instead of the accidentally used paragraph tag.
            
            The title tag defines the document/page's title shown in the title bar of the browser on the page's tab.
            You may read more here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title
            More Information will be available on the title tag when I update it and explain it more in the next episode.
            
            Sorry for the inconvience.
